Amulya Bodla(abodla)
        Grammar rules:
                Implemented grammar rules for conditional and arithmetic operations.
        Verification:
                Verified using test cases if the grammar is compliant with the grammar rules.
Piyush Reddy(prmudire)
        Design:
                Optimized Workflow for the Grammar (by eliminating left recursion cases)
        Validation:
                Validated if all the required features could be implemented.
Niharika Pothana(npothana)
        Grammar rules: 
                Implemented grammar rules for terminals and iterative loops. 
        Validation:
                Validated if all the required features could be implemented.	
Ritesh Reddy(ranugu)
        Design:
                Established Constraints for the Grammar (regex, patterns for terminals., etc)
        Verification:
                Verified using test cases if the grammar is compliant with the grammar rules.
